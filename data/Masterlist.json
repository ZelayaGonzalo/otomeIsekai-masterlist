    "description": "Is this seriously the world of a \"game\"? If I don't romance one of the yanderes, I would die!? Before my reincarnation, I was a former delinquent and a top-class brawler who was once called the \"Crimson Rose\" or the Crimson Demon\", who had gathered the interest of other delinquents. It's easier to talk with fist than to talk about love, so naturally my romancing skill is zero. Despite this, it seems that I have reincarnated as a game's heroine who has a family of good standing and a gentle appearance! In order to protect my life while cooperating with the investigation of the incident, I will try my best to fall in love, but... The person herself hasn't realized it. Serina, the daughter of an Earl and a former delinquent, is cherished and loved by her surrounding. This is the story of her journey to obtain happiness.\n",

When her embarrassment levels exceed a certain limit, she will explode into anger. However, the point that she’s suppressing under the surface is that she wouldn’t mind that sort of thing if it were in a less public place.\"\n<br><br>\nAs Endo-kun passionately reacts to the antics of Lady Liselotte, the villainess of an otome game, Kobayashi-san provides a painstaking breakdown of her tsundere behaviour. Suddenly, one person could hear their voices; Liselotte’s fiancée, Prince Siegward. That is where this story begins.\n",

Since I have transmigrated into this world, I can’t stand by and watch my favorite character die. Additionally, I also don’t want to die.

So, when she has the opportunity to take her sister’s place in an arranged marriage to Emperor Kael Lu Kaldorf, Lilian jumps at the chance.

Now, tasked with the duty of keeping His Majesty well-rested, Lilian must kiss the emperor each night to keep his temper at bay. It’s a simple contractual agreement, and Lilian has no plans to develop romantic feelings, but what happens when Kael unexpectedly falls for her?\n<br><br>(Source: Tappytoon)",

Imagine her surprise when she receives a marriage proposal from the sought-after Simeon, second-in-command of the Royal Order of Knights! Simeon, the heir to an earldom, is highly accomplished in scholarly and military arts—and he’s gorgeous. So why did he propose to such an unremarkable noblewoman? Despite being a target of envy and scorn, Marielle is happy. After all, Simeon seems to be exactly her type: a dashingly handsome man with glasses who appears gentle on the outside, but who has a dark and scheming side! Welcome to Marielle’s world, where people aren’t always what they seem—and a prim, proper exterior can hide the heart of a sly and devious fangirl!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",

The current royal family values lineage above all else, with several generations of consanguineous marriages, to preserve its “purity.” The politics of the Kingdom, following the idea of the pureblood noblemen’s superiority, caused national power to decline. To retain the power of the Kingdom, the Royal Family decided to take a desperate measure, a marriage with a woman from the ethnic group to which belongs the majority of the population. The bitterness of this act… Those who were previously considered a subjugated group of people living on the frontiers.\n<br><br>\nThe chosen bride is Berta, the first daughter of the current lord of Kasha, the largest estate on the frontier and also a powerful faction. The marriage life started in hard mode, a husband that doesn’t love her, a Queen that hates her, however, she still is forced to fulfil her role duties. Berta has decided to endure the hardship, that was already expected by her, and wait for the day when there’s no more need of her in the palace, and she can return home. However, Berta’s initial plans are ruined by an unexpected situation. After passing three nights with the King, as the royal rules dictated for a newlywed bride, Berta got pregnant with His Majesty’s child!!\n<br><br>\n<i>Note: Includes 1 extra chapter.</i>\n",

He becomes infatuated with me and I climb my way up the royal social ladder!<br><br>\nMy normal everyday life used to consist of my job, that didn’t depend on me and my hobby, gardening. It’s a modest lifestyle of living alone. Then one day, I open a door to another world-<br><br>\nI suddenly realized that there was an open air bath! After I broke off from some naked man and gathered my surroundings, I found out that I am Rosalind, the daughter of a ruined noble. I have absolutely no money, but if I can raise my favorite plants and make some money, I will persist and keep on living in this world. <br><br>\nI come from a low social standing so there is the chance I’ll be harassed, but this mysterious man - Alexander - whose origins are unknown, has been taking care of me. Who exactly is he?<br><br>\n<b>Note:</b><i> The work is on hiatus since March 17, 2020 due to the health condition of the author.</i>\n",

Only to wake back up as an eleven-year-old! With time rewound and a second chance at life dropped into her lap, she sets out to right the countless wrongs that plague the ailing Empire. Corrupt governance? Check. Border troubles? Check. Natural calamities and economic strife? Check. My, seems like a lot of work. Hard work and Mia don’t mix, so she seeks out the aid of others, starting with her loyal maid, Anne, and the brilliant minister, Ludwig. Together, they strive day and night to restore the Empire. Little by little, their tireless efforts begin to change the course of history, pushing the whole of the continent toward a new future. And why did the selfish princess have a change of heart, you ask? Simple—she didn’t. She’s just terrified of the guillotine. They hurt like hell, and Mia hates pain more than work. Lazy, selfish, and a complete coward, the ill-equipped princess of the Tearmoon Empire, armed with memories of her past life and a diary from the future, tries to avoid dying at the guillotine again and changes the very course of history in the process!\n<br><br>\n(Source: J-Novel Club, edited)",

In contrast, Elizabeth is seen as an out-of-touch aristocrat who loves to throw lavish parties and frequent the royal palace. Although she works hard for the good of the kingdom, her contributions go largely unnoticed because of her unsavory reputation. One of the few people who are willing to give her a chance is the Archduke of Winternight, the “monster of the North.” As a misunderstood soul himself, he feels a special connection to her and opens up his home. And so, Elizabeth moves to the far North, away from the people she’s known her whole life... Will she finally be able to start over with a clean slate? Or will her past stand in the way of her future with the Archduke?\n<br><br>\n(Source: Tappytoon)\n<br><br>\nChapter Count:<br>\nSeason 1: Prologue + 99 chapters<br>\nIntermission: 10 chapters<br>\nSeason 2: 82 chapters",

In her second life, she was reincarnated into another world (not an otome game) as an orphan from the slums. She became hailed as the country's prophet, teaching several students who grew up to be some of the country's top elites. In her third and current life, she was reincarnated as a daughter of a noble family.<br><br>\nBorn with the beauty and wealth she hoped for, she had thought that this time she would be able to live freely collecting cute things and indulging in fashion, things she was unable to do in her first life as she feared that they did not fit her. However, she discovered that not only had she been reborn into the same country where only 10 years had passed, but her father was her apprentice and her mother was the one who ran her over and killed her in her second life. Before her death, she had seen four futures in which she would get rejected by different guys and another one where she would be killed. Remembering this, she made a resolution to experience a wonderful romance and hide her past as a prophet.",

Destined for terrible ends, I've died twice—but I refuse to die a third time as a pawn in someone else's scheme. I’m no longer the vain and naïve princess. Now that I know how the story will unfold, I’ll turn the tables around and have everyone dancing to my tune. This time, I’ll be the one pulling the strings.<br><br>(Source: Tapas)",

    "description": "I realized after going back in time. My husband who had an affair had an affair again, and the woman he had an affair with appeared in front of me again. Also, I don’t have much time left to live. “ Let’s get a divorce.” “ ...What” “ I don’t have a single penny to give you, so take out everything I bought you and leave. Hey, I mean everything. That’s including your underwear too.” “ Why are you suddenly doing this?” “ Suddenly?” I had a twisted smile on my face. I always knew he was a shameless person, but this is a bit too much. “ You should know that more than me, you sex-crazed bastard.”",

    "description": "One day, when she was chewing on some bread she'd gotten for her snack, the thirteen-year-old Dahlia Pesteros suddenly remembered her past life. This was the world of a tragic otome game where the characters went crazy, and I was born as the younger sister of the future's greatest villain! At this rate, there would be no solution. <br>\nThe household would be eliminated, and my head would get cut off. That's why I have to get out of this household as fast as possible! \"I'll make him let his guard down and then I'll escape!\" It was going well up until I got rid of the relative who was aiming for our household, plus others such as the snake-like Emperor, and received Brother's approval... \"I want to dance with Dahlia. What's the problem?\" \"Unfortunately, my younger sister is shy.\" \"I said that I like Dahlia the most!\" Somehow, I tamed my brother too much, and now the strongest characters in the world are obsessed with me!",
