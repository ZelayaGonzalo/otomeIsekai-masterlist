Before my reincarnation, I was a former delinquent and a top-class brawler who was once called the \"Crimson Rose\" or the Crimson Demon\", who had gathered the interest of other delinquents. It's easier to talk with fist than to talk about love, so naturally my romancing skill is zero. Despite this, it seems that I have reincarnated as a game's heroine who has a family of good standing and a gentle appearance! In order to protect my life while cooperating with the investigation of the incident, I will try my best to fall in love, but... The person herself hasn't realized it. Serina, the daughter of an Earl and a former delinquent, is cherished and loved by her surrounding. This is the story of her journey to obtain happiness. ",

Determined to change her fate, she tries to befriend Nocturne, but little does she know that he is the only living black mage who can hear, sense, and even control people’s thoughts and emotions.

    "description": "I entered a novel in which the heroine who reincarnated as a saintess has to walk on a thorny path. ‘Yeah, nope!’ I, who decided to walk on a flower path, abandoned the original frustrating family and adopted my bias as my dad in our first meeting.  “You, be my daddy!” The story’s final boss and villain! But now he’s just my dad. Fufu. “Daddy, why is your name also daddy? So cute.”  “What did you eat for breakfast? Handsomeness?” {a pun that I’m too lazy to explain} As I dream of a happy ending for Daddy, there’s just one more huge obstacle… The existence of the hero who would kill the final boss. Now that it’s come to this, let’s save my bias and the hero as an addition! If I have time, maybe the world too! However…  “I’ll kill you if you approach my daughter.” …Daddy keeps on raising the death flags. “You should take responsibility since you tamed me.” Somehow the hero is also obsessed over me, just what’s going on…?  Note: This is a one shot promotional manhwa for the novel of the same name ",

When she fell down in the snow, no one spared her a glance. It was truly a dreadful winter.  While living day to day like a doll on a display shelf, Neveah was engaged as part of a pre-natal agreement between her father and her fiancé’s father. Her fiancé was a Wistash. Duke Valor Wistash.  As in the prelude to every tragedy, it all began with a damned love.  “Love has its moments. You missed them all, and now I don’t love you anymore.” Neveah said to her fiancé who had never once looked at her for the past decade, then left the Empire for the neighboring country where she was welcomed with open arms.  She didn’t expect anything there and was simply planning to live quietly, but the Emperor’s attitude towards her was exceedingly friendly.  “I want you to be happy. You can wish for anything and do as you please. I want to give you a season where you don’t have to be constantly wary of other people.”  After meeting Arendt, Neveah's winter began to overflow… into spring as the snow began to melt.

As her self proclaimed guardian, her uncle Benjamin, a scumbag who coveted her mother, took her in as his niece. The only rebellious thing that little Louise could do whilst in her uncle's grasp was to kill herself. But for some reason, Louise returned to the year her mother died. The joy of meeting her mother again wasn't able to prevent her death from repeating, so she left to find her father. Her mother's words, \"Dad is alive\" were the only clue she had, and that would eventually change her fate in this life. I escaped from Benjamin and barely made it to my dad's house, but he wasn't the only one there? <br>\n<br>\n(Source: Kakao, translated)",

She is taken in by a wealthy couple, and they and her new spirit helper treat her with nothing but kindness. There is one problem, however—the food in this magical world is gross! Lisa insists on helping the household cooking staff prepare a traditional meal from her world, and it is a big hit with her hosts.

But as she was being dragged to Heaven by orders from the Buddha, she notices a strange tunnel leading to the human world in which she escapes into...  And the place where she fell is the Republic of Korea's Jeju Island! And she meets a guy named Lee Hyun?!

However, this man is in no way going as planned. To add, even a weird rumor is going around. That I and Palus are lovers, with plans of a wedding ahead.  “We’re not lovers. It’s just me who cannot live without her.”  Huh? What is this guy saying right now! Why is he adding fuel to the fire! “Crown Prince, the King said...” What of these bad rumors, this much I expected once I decided to be the Crown Prince’s support. “You have fallen for Noo-nim and that you cannot come to your senses.”  However, that wasn’t true. False rumors must have morality! In fact, he likes men! “That being blind to jealousy, you broke the wrist of a man, getting close to Noo-nim on spot.”  “……” No, I mean that’s not completely untrue. But, that might not be the reason…  “I also heard rumors that you might officially marry Noo-nim soon.”  “……” No. That’s never true!

I woke up but instead of becoming the heroine, I'd become the villainess, Louise Sweeney, who meets a terrible ending.  \"Since I know the original novel, if I just avoid falling in love at first sight with the male lead, I definitely won't have a tragic ending!\" Thinking this, Louise avoids the male lead.  But what's this...? Unlike the original novel, the male lead passionately confesses his love to Louise, and the heroine, who she believed to be kind, has it in for her...?!  How did this happen?

Our new, full-fledged Louise Sweeny must try to reinvent her character to dodge her doomed fate of being killed off at the end of the story. It seemed easy enough at first, but there’s one big problem. The story, which she knew like the back of her hand, has veered so far off course that she can’t predict what plot twists are coming next. Can she avoid getting in the way of the male and female leads’ romance to save herself from impending demise?\n<br><br>\n(Source: Webtoons)",

Rosalite’s little brother, though, is fated to die in the story at 20 and that just seems really unfair after all the drama he’s been through (did I mention his story is a BL?). Now that I’m Rosalite, I decide to save him. But no matter how hard I try, he just keeps dying and every time he dies, I turn back into 16-year-old Rosalite. Ten or so deaths later, I’m more determined than ever to save him. Rich, royal, or sexy foreigner: whoever touches my little brother will die!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Tappytoon)",

Vowing to exact revenge if ever given the chance, Kaira is thrust back in time to right the wrongs committed against her and reclaim the title that is rightfully hers. As she joins hands with Prince Faylon and sets out to punish those who conspired against her, she’ll discover a world she once took for granted and seek to correct the course of her fate.

When she wakes up in a fictional world as Lariensa’s best friend Marilyn, she quickly realizes that her favorite novel’s star desperately needs her protection. The thing is, Lariensa is just a little too sweet for her own good, which makes her an easy target for master manipulators like Sibel Noma Kahn. As Lariensa’s loyal friend, it’s up to Marilyn to save her from the boy who will one day ruin her life. But Marilyn’s desperate attempts to circumvent Sibel only seem to pique his devilish curiosity. With the antagonist now suddenly interested in her, Marilyn sets out to foil Sibel's sinister plot to use her to get to Lariensa.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Tappytoon)",

Though it doesn’t appear so in the eyes of my uncle, tyrant Emperor Tess Illuminas.  “Auntie, trust in me only! I’ll make you walk on a flower path!” Amelia enters the imperial palace only for her aunt. But this uncle doesn’t seem like the tyrant in the novel at all? Rather, it just seems like there’s a lack of affection?  “I can’t help it! Amelia will make everyone happy!” Nowadays, children play matchmaking as a hobby, right? I’ll try it out.",

Elena's son is thus taken from her, and she is murdered.\n<br><br>\nIn a twist of events however, she ends up returning to the past.\n<br><br>\n<i>\"I will crush each and every one of you.\"</i>\n<br><br>\n<i>\"I will never live the life of a puppet again.\"</i>\n<br><br>\nAnd so begins Elena's second life, swearing vengeance on her enemies.",

Only to wake back up as an eleven-year-old! With time rewound and a second chance at life dropped into her lap, she sets out to right the countless wrongs that plague the ailing Empire. Corrupt governance? Check. Border troubles? Check. Natural calamities and economic strife? Check. My, seems like a lot of work. Hard work and Mia don’t mix, so she seeks out the aid of others, starting with her loyal maid, Anne, and the brilliant minister, Ludwig. Together, they strive day and night to restore the Empire. Little by little, their tireless efforts begin to change the course of history, pushing the whole of the continent toward a new future. And why did the selfish princess have a change of heart, you ask? Simple—she didn’t. She’s just terrified of the guillotine. They hurt like hell, and Mia hates pain more than work. Lazy, selfish, and a complete coward, the ill-equipped princess of the Tearmoon Empire, armed with memories of her past life and a diary from the future, tries to avoid dying at the guillotine again and changes the very course of history in the process!

Due to a misinterpretation of an oracle, she had been raised as a \"Child of Fate\" and was asked to choose a guardian. During the first time she lived her life, she lived in a strict knight's household, but when the real \"Child of Fate\" appeared, she was sacrificed as a scapegoat for them. During the second time, she was abused by an outwardly respectable scholar; the third time, she ran away and lived as a beggar. Since the country seems to not be safe for her, she decided to leave it this time. To that end she chose …a family of the biggest and coldest villains in the kingdom. She just tried to get along with them for the time being, but her family has turned out to be absurdly overprotective and doting?! ",

When Julia sells one of her talismans to a stranger who seemed to be weighed down by an apparition, she learns that kindness isn’t always repaid in coins, as the mysterious man asks to marry her in return. This man is actually Duke Leo Sirius Epesia, one of the most influential noblemen in the Floren Kingdom, and he seems to recognize her from 10 years ago. In the end, Julia is swayed into working as the duke’s personal ghostbuster, in exchange for a handsome reward. After all, what good is a loveless marriage compared to cold, hard cash?<br><br>(Source: TappyToon)",

The tragedy cast her into the primordial Light of Origin, which not only revealed to her a dangerous secret... but also reincarnated her! She now lives as Lyse Winslette, the humble daughter of a poor baron in a neighboring country, who is doing everything in her power to keep her distance from the empire because of the forbidden knowledge she possesses. Lyse thus works her days away at the royal palace of Olwen as a lady-in-waiting. And she’s rightfully mortified when she’s chosen to attend the visiting Razanate emperor. Little does she know that she’s about to learn another state secret that’s going to land her... an engagement to an imperial knight?! She’ll have to use all her skills—from this life and her last—to get out of this mess. Yet what is this strange feeling when she touches her fiancé’s hand? Just who is Sidis, and what secrets is HE keeping?  (Source: J-Novel Club)",

      "description": "Despite her supposed ineptitude with regular magic, Princess Anisphia defies the aristocracy’s expectations by developing “magicology,” a unique magical theory based on memories from her past life. One day, she witnesses the brilliant noblewoman Euphyllia unjustly stripped of her title as the kingdom’s next monarch. That’s when Anisphia concocts a plan to help Euphyllia regain her good name-which somehow involves them living together and researching magic!  Little do these two ladies know, however, that their chance encounter will alter not only their own futures, but those of the kingdom...and the entire world!\n<br><br>\n(Source: Yen Press)",

In her past life she was obsessed with the brother of the Villainess, Alexei, but seeing him in real life is so much better than in the game! It’s just that, her brother’s upbringing is just so sad that she cries every time she thinks about it!\n<br><br>\n“Okay! I’m going to escape mine, and my country’s destruction flag and make sure everyone lives happily!”\n<br><br>\nThus the Villainess from the prestigious 400 year old Yurinova Dukedom along with her sharp tongued tendencies back when she was a corporate slave forged on forward. With her common sense and knowledge of history she plans on saving her brother and overcoming all the game events.\n<br><br>\nFor some reason, as time went by her talented brother became more and more of a siscon. Wait no, he was a siscon to begin with but, she’s more than happy to spend more time with her brother as a brocon and siscon.\n<br><br>\nAnd as time went by, her plan to avoid the Heroine and the Prince death flag has become more and more messed up. Why? No no, the two of them are good people, and good friends, but,\n<br><br>\n“Prince, stay far far away from me.”\n<br><br>\nEven so, the settings of the Otome game she played before are completely messed up in this world, nothing is the same.\n<br><br>\nAnyways!

After completing all routes of the game, a mysterious voice asks for her wish. Furious and choked up, she shouts to save her ultimate bias and to give him a happy life.    Waking up as Senepin, the villianess who harrasses the main character, she enjoys her dream where she could talk to Rumins, alive and well.  That is, until, ‘Senepin’ realizes that her new self was not a dream.  Senepin remembers that the only time Rumins survived his damned endings was when he ended up together with the female lead, Belkina. Realizing this, she makes it her utmost priority to get Rumins and Belkina together.  But for some reason, Rumins seems more interested in Senepin than the original female lead. Will ‘Senepin’ be able to save Rumins? ",

Then one day, she opens her eyes and realizes that she has become Aila Mertensia, the antagonist of a novel she had written ten years ago.

But to her dismay, she soon finds herself stuck in a time loop where her day repeats endlessly, and the only way to escape the loop is to act like Aila Mertensia! Haneul doesn’t know the first thing about acting like a villainess. Luckily for her, a mysterious warlock by the name of Killian offers to help her become a true villainess. Her only option is to make a deal with him, but can Haneul really trust this devilishly handsome man?\n<br><br>(Source: Tappytoon)",

The House of Grand Duke Vailot came to sponsor an orphan.”</i>\n<br><br>\nTo find a way to live, I threw myself at the villain's family, the Grand Duke’s, and-\n<br><br>\n<i>“You can do whatever you want. I, as the Grand Duke, will protect you.”</i>\n<br><br>\n<i>“You’re not an orphan. You’re my younger sister.”</i>\n<br><br>\nWhy do they love me?\n<br><br>\nJust as I made up my mind to live well since I'd already become a lady of the House of Grand Duke Vailot...\n<br><br>\n<i>\"I have searched for you for a long time, my child.\"</i>\n<br><br>\nThis time my biologically related father, the Emperor loves me. Why are you acting like this? I said, I don't need you guys who wouldn't have listened to what Shuelina had to say. I refuse to accept your love!\n<br><br>(Source: Kakao, translated)<br><br>\n<i>Note: Promotional prologue for the homonym web novel.</i>",

Disappointed as she is, she quickly accepts her fate and decides to make the best of her new life. The good news is that Lecian's character has a happy ending, but the bad news is that she's supposed to die once to get it. Between foiling her abusive new father’s plans of committing treason, finding a way out of her engagement to the crown prince, and avoiding the strange duke who seems to be stalking her, Jeongyun has a very long to-do list. Will Jeongyun be able to adjust to her new life while figuring out a way to avoid dying a second time?\n<br><br>\n(Source: Tappytoon)",

      "description": "As the very first human to step foot in this world, Darjeeling is showered with love and admiration. But instead of spreading the love she receives, she keeps it all for herself inside a treasure chest. Then one day, God descends from the skies and takes her treasure chest away. Until she can find the answer to his riddle, Darjeeling must wander the earth forever, drifting from one soul to the next. This time, she finds herself trapped inside a body of a young princess, which means she must first learn how to walk and talk before she can even go hunting for clues. Then there are her new \"friends\"... a group of children whose idea of fun is running around and screaming at the top of their lungs. Is her new life doomed from the start? Or will she discover a way to finally break her curse?<br><br>(Source: Tappytoon)",

One day, a man destroyed the research facility I was in, and upon recognizing him, I discovered I was in the world of a hopeless reverse harem novel. After I escaped from the research facility, I was living a normal life--until I moved in right next to the female lead’s house.

If everything goes according to plan, the female lead would save the villain, who fainted after being fatally injured, and would become the subject of his fanatical obsession. But why is the sub male lead villain here, unconscious in front of my house? Lakius Avalon was the king of the dark world, as well as the fearsome man I'd met at the research facility.  I looked around quickly, then shoved his body with my foot. \"You've come to the wrong house, villain.\" ",
